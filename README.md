# LeetCode Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode challenges repository in JavaScript. The goal of this project is to solve one challenge per day until completing a total of 30 easy, 30 medium, and 30 hard challenges in 90 days.

I choose to use JavaScript as my programming language of choice for problem-solving due to its ability to deliver fast development times. This enables me to spend less time on the syntax and more time focusing on the core logic of the problems. Additionally, JavaScript's dynamic nature allows for quick prototyping, which is crucial when solving coding challenges that often require multiple iterations and trial-and-error.

As a note, I'd like to add that the testing tool used in this project is the built-in assert and test library of Node.js, which provides a simple way to write tests for JavaScript code without any external dependencies. It's a powerful tool for verifying the correctness of the solutions and ensuring that they meet the requirements of the challenges.

## Repository Structure

In the root of the repository, you will find three folders: easy, medium, and hard, containing challenges classified by their difficulty level. Each challenge is in an individual folder and includes two files: solution.js and test.js.

```md
solution.js: contains the solution to the challenge in JavaScript.
test.js: contains unit tests to verify that the solution is correct.
```

## Challenge Rules

- The timer must start as soon as you start reading the problem.
- You may only use built-in features/libraries.
- All programming languages are allowed.
- The challenges must completely pass the LeetCode tests.

## Used Technlogies

This project uses several technologies to solve the LeetCode challenges and test the solutions. The main technologies used are:

- Node.js v19.8.1: The built-in test library in Node.js is used to run the unit tests for each solution.

- RunJS: RunJS is used as an IDE to write and test the code, allowing for faster development times and quicker feedback on the solutions.

- VSCode: VSCode is used as the primary code editor to write the test cases for each solution.

- Git: Git is used to version control the code and upload the challenges to GitHub.

By utilizing these technologies, the project aims to provide an efficient and effective way to solve the LeetCode challenges and improve programming skills.
