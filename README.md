# LeetCode Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode challenges repository in JavaScript. The goal of this project is to solve one challenge per day until completing a total of 30 easy, 30 medium, and 30 hard challenges in 90 days.

I choose to use JavaScript as my programming language of choice for problem-solving due to its ability to deliver fast development times. This enables me to spend less time on the syntax and more time focusing on the core logic of the problems. Additionally, JavaScript's dynamic nature allows for quick prototyping, which is crucial when solving coding challenges that often require multiple iterations and trial-and-error.

As a note, I'd like to add that the testing tool used in this project is the built-in assert and test library of Node.js, which provides a simple way to write tests for JavaScript code without any external dependencies. It's a powerful tool for verifying the correctness of the solutions and ensuring that they meet the requirements of the challenges.

## Repository Structure

In the root of the repository, you will find three folders: easy, medium, and hard, containing challenges classified by their difficulty level. Each challenge is in an individual folder and includes two files: solution.js and test.js.

```md
solution.js: contains the solution to the challenge in JavaScript.
test.js: contains unit tests to verify that the solution is correct.
```
